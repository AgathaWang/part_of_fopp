    A palindrome is a phrase that, if reversed, would read the exact same. Write code that checks 
    if ``p_phrase`` is a palindrome by reversing it and then checking if the reversed version is 
    equal to the original. Assign the reversed version of ``p_phrase`` to the variable ``r_phrase`` 
    so that we can check your work.
    ~~~~
    p_phrase = "was it a car or a cat I saw"
