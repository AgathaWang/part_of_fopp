    Currently there is a string called ``str1``. Write code to create a list called ``chars`` which 
    should contain the characters from ``str1``. Each character in ``str1`` should be its own element 
    in the list ``chars``.
    ~~~~
    str1 = "I love python"
    # HINT: what's the accumulator? That should go here.
